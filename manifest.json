Query birding hotspots by location, explore region hierarchies, discover recent rare bird sightings, and find the best places to go birding.\n\n**Privacy & Security:** This server only makes HTTP requests to the public eBird API (api.ebird.org). It does NOT access your filesystem, read/write files, or execute any commands on your system. All tools are read-only and require your eBird API key for authentication with eBird's service.",
